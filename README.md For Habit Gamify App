💡 How It Works (Short Explanation)

Habits are stored locally using AsyncStorage.

When the user completes a habit:

*   XP increases
*   Progress updates
*   Stats screen refreshes
*   UI updates instantly using React Context (HabitContext.js).

Navigation is handled by React Navigation (Stack + Tabs).
